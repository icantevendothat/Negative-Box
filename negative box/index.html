    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Negative Box</h1>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;"> The "Negative Box" is an interactive and customizable instrument that allows users to hear picures. 
      To construct the inner workings of the box, I used the adafruit AS7341 10-Channel Light Color Sensor Breakout, which I then connected to 
      Ableton through p5.js. Each of the 8 color readings that the sensor takes is mapped to a control change on Ableton which determines things
      like pitch, reverb, filter cutoff, and many more things. In order for the sensor to see the color-light readings, film negatives are used 
      in the box, which also contains magenta, yellow, and blue lights so the sensor can read the pictures as they were taken. 

      Once this was done, I had to find a way for my music box to be easy to use. I was inspired by those tiny hand-crank music boxes that only 
      play one song, and I thought of a design that would work easily with a user and with the sensor. I then build a little house for my breadboard, 
      and sat the roll of film negatives on top, to let light though to the center. At the end of the box, there is a similarly designed hand hand-crank
     for users to propel the box on their own.</p>
